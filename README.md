WalletBuddies is a mobile app for groups to pool in funds on a cyclic basis to use for things they do together 
like Happy Hour, Sunday Brunches, Movies, Watch Sports, Savings etc. Think of WalletBuddies as a recurring Tilt.

Here's what WalletBuddies will do for your group:
1. Pick something your group wants to do: Happy Hour, Sunday Brunches, Movies, Watch Sports, Savings etc.
2. Pick how often you want to do this: Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly.
3. Pick how much you want to spend on this per person: $10, $20, $30 etc. - any number you want.
4. After your group is formed WalletBuddies will debit from all of your accounts every Week/Bi-week/Month based on the amount and frequency you have chosen.
5. WalletBuddies will then pool this amount and push the funds to one person in the group.
6. Use this pooled amount to fund your group activity.
7. This cycle will continue until everyone in the group has been credited the pooled amount.
